## Currently I can’t install this anywhere in any project → failure

pay attention to this time fix this:

- the init install must get users → to the selection of by-step guides; detection of their project including
    - the appending “concepts” of us → to global or project-based
    - the GSD framework https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done (again this is used as client-service at user’s project) → that what they are and how the wrappers tend to do
        - hierarchy and types of concepts (documents? governance? artifacts? and concepts? so on..)
        - when we wrap something into what it does → what the concepts changed etc
        - the absolute correct wrap non-breaking
    - there must be the scripts, tools as for configuration and settings

## Revamp the concepts by putting deep thoughts into this (and the dos and donts)

1. For the appending agents https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/  (study the configuration very carefully) - to ensure hierarchy, and accuracy of when and where they got called and by which other agents (not only of the appended but to the wrapped agents as well); so look more into the hierarchy manipulation concepts (knowing there are up to 3 level of cycles of delegations, and settings that use to manipulate them are mode: primary, all and subagents - subagents can’t call any other agents; but agents set at all can delegate multi level, but if agents are particularly just for being delegated make them subagents. And to manipulate subagents not being called manually by users make them hidden which is only for delegation tasks)  and there should be these agents (high-level only you must think more to make them valid)
    1. supreme_coordinator (top highest)
    2. high-level-governance → doing the high and mid governance → they must be able to auto append prompts  and system prompts or initiate commands to force a workflow for instance ; these are also the way for them to adapt new profile
    3. low-level-validator: there are all sort validation work but these will directly do the grep, list, glob, seaarch and keyword regrex or run tools and run test kind of things
    4. idumb-builder: this will run tools, folllow appended prompt and commands, will spawn initially to wrap context to intended framework in yaml frontmatter (of course following the hierarchy) + also literately edit the appended concepts to match to certain conditions and the project >>> there must be a very meticulous design for this that match nested levels and relationship. And during phases this want must be updated too
2. commands and CLI commands → users will use these to initiate something - of course starting with init but not to make these overlapping with any others make sure they are all prefixed with `idumb` → as for these can be used by for the rest
3. I know most of what you are going to created can fail desperately but at least the testing concepts for this prototype must work

## Dos and Donts for the OpenCode Plugin and as Framework wrapper:

 

| Concepts | DO | DONTS | RESEARCH + THINK ABOUT |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| As a Plugin to instal by users |   • Understand all the concepts of what is a plugin in OpenCode 
  • Understanding the concepts of OpenCode using as client-side - when users use it as a platform to develop project
  • Do understand the core concepts or what drive OpenCode as a platform to developer using agentic coding: `commands`, `agents`, `subagents` , `innate tools` , `customized tools`, `rules`, `skills,`  , `sessions` , `lsp server`, `mcp server`
  • understand the 2-level of OpenCode platforms, global setting, and project
  •Understand extra concepts provided must click into either, both, or some of the above  |   • DON’T assume anything related to OpenCode concepts as in this development environment
  • DON’T misunderstanding to fall into :users using any core source code of OpenCode
  • DON’T be creative to create something that DO NOT work in OpenCOde | look for pages online for the official instructions - Think about users use the plugins by installing them from github page, npm, pnpm, npx command |
| As a plugin that provide wrappers |   • if providing any extra concepts → must align and point to the original framework in this case GSD
  • wrap the concepts into the framework with all the aware of the ecosystem, hierarchy, relationship, the flow, the governance of the intended framework |   • DON’T assume anything work if not making any connection points
  • DON’T assume it works if it does not reflect hierarchy, nor integration
  • DON’T assume it works if it has no governance
  • DON’T break any concepts (either core, short-live artifacts in any level of the intended frame-work) 
  •  |   • Learn the concepts |
| Working with users’ current project |   • DO understand the projects are varied, and that they are in multiple level of complexity and at any stage |   • DON’T assume users will do this nor the others if there are not guidance, not one place but throughout |  |
| Work across concepts, into hierarchy, activate automation, engaging in governance and validation activities of the framework and under OpenCode concepts  |   • Do understand as hierarchy as above but also  how they behave when wrapped
  • DO understand to activate automation, validation and self-governance >>> there must be a meticulous approach to multi-level and cross-concepts integration points  |   • DON’T assume that agent workflow get immediate constitute or obey to with just a rule in one place. Enforcement must not be scattered and unthoughtful
  • DON’T assume that what you introduce work → must ensure the agent of the project consume it at not only the start of the conversation but also pin it throughout |  |
