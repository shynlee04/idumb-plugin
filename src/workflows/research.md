# Research Workflow

## Purpose
Systematic research process for gathering domain knowledge, best practices, and implementation approaches before creating plans.

## When to Use
- Starting a new project or phase
- Unfamiliar with the technology/domain
- Need to validate approach before planning
- Complex integration requirements

## Input
- Research topic or question
- Target technology/domain
- Specific constraints or requirements

## Output
- Research summary document (RESEARCH.md)
- Key findings and recommendations
- Implementation approaches evaluated
- Risk assessment

## Steps

### Step 1: Define Research Scope
**Agent:** @idumb-project-researcher or @idumb-phase-researcher

Define:
- Research questions
- Scope boundaries
- Success criteria
- Time budget

### Step 2: Gather Information
**Agent:** Researcher

Activities:
- Search documentation
- Review best practices
- Analyze similar implementations
- Identify potential pitfalls

### Step 3: Synthesize Findings
**Agent:** @idumb-research-synthesizer

Consolidate:
- Multiple research sources
- Conflicting information
- Key insights
- Recommendations

### Step 4: Document Results
**Agent:** Researcher

Create RESEARCH.md with:
- Executive summary
- Detailed findings
- Implementation options
- Risk analysis
- Recommendations

## Research Checklist

- [ ] Research scope defined
- [ ] Sources identified and reviewed
- [ ] Best practices documented
- [ ] Implementation options compared
- [ ] Risks assessed
- [ ] Recommendations made
- [ ] RESEARCH.md created

## Success Criteria
1. Research answers the original questions
2. Implementation approach is validated
3. Risks are identified and mitigated
4. Findings are documented for team reference
