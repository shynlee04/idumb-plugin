# Research Template

Template for `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-RESEARCH.md` - comprehensive ecosystem research before planning.

**Purpose:** Document what Claude needs to know to implement a phase well - not just "which library" but "how do experts build this."

<standard_stack>
## Standard Stack

The established libraries/tools for this domain:

### Core

|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| [name] | [ver] | [what it does] | [use case] |
| [name] | [ver] | [what it does] | [use case] |

<dont_hand_roll>
## Don't Hand-Roll

Problems that look simple but have existing solutions:

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| [problem] | [what you'd build] | [library] | [edge cases, complexity] |
| [problem] | [what you'd build] | [library] | [edge cases, complexity] |
| [problem] | [what you'd build] | [library] | [edge cases, complexity] |

**Key insight:** [why custom solutions are worse in this domain]

## Guidelines

**When to create:**
- Before planning phases in niche/complex domains
- When Claude's training data is likely stale or sparse
- When "how do experts do this" matters more than "which library"

**Structure:**
- Use XML tags for section markers (matches iDumb templates)
- Seven core sections: summary, standard_stack, architecture_patterns, dont_hand_roll, common_pitfalls, code_examples, sources
- All sections required (drives comprehensive research)

**Content quality:**
- Standard stack: Specific versions, not just names
- Architecture: Include actual code examples from authoritative sources
- Don't hand-roll: Be explicit about what problems to NOT solve yourself
- Pitfalls: Include warning signs, not just "don't do this"
- Sources: Mark confidence levels honestly

**Integration with planning:**
- RESEARCH.md loaded as @context reference in PLAN.md
- Standard stack informs library choices
- Don't hand-roll prevents custom solutions
- Pitfalls inform verification criteria
- Code examples can be referenced in task actions

**After creation:**
- File lives in phase directory: `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-RESEARCH.md`
- Referenced during planning workflow
- plan-phase loads it automatically when present

## iDumb Integration

**Agent Flow:**

```
/idumb:research-phase N
            ↓
@idumb-high-governance routes to @idumb-phase-researcher
            ↓
@idumb-phase-researcher uses:
  - context7_query-docs for library docs
  - exa_web_search_exa for current patterns
  - brave-search for alternatives
            ↓
Outputs RESEARCH.md to .planning/phases/XX/
            ↓
@idumb-planner loads RESEARCH.md when planning
```

**MCP Tool Usage:**

| Section | Primary Tool | Secondary Tool |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| standard_stack | context7_resolve-library-id | exa_get_code_context |
| architecture_patterns | context7_query-docs | exa_web_search |
| dont_hand_roll | context7_query-docs | brave-search |
| code_examples | context7_query-docs | exa_get_code_context |
| sota_updates | brave-search | exa_web_search |
| common_pitfalls | brave-search | context7_query-docs |

**Research Quality Gates:**

Before RESEARCH.md is complete, verify:
- [ ] All confidence levels assigned
- [ ] At least 3 code examples with sources
- [ ] At least 3 pitfalls documented
- [ ] Standard stack has specific versions
- [ ] Alternatives considered for each core library
