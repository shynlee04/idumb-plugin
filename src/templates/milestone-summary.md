# Milestone Summary Template

Generates the summary document when a milestone is completed.

## Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
---
type: milestone-summary
milestone: "{milestone_id}"
milestone_name: "{name}"
status: "complete"
created: "{iso_timestamp}"
phases_completed: "{count}"
total_duration: "{duration}"
---
```

## Document Structure

```markdown
# Milestone: {Milestone Name} - Summary

## 🎉 Milestone Complete

**Started:** {start_date}
**Completed:** {completion_date}
**Duration:** {total_duration}

## Overview

| Metric | Value |

## Generation Triggers

```yaml
triggers:
  automatic:
    condition: "Last phase of milestone verified"
    workflow: "workflows/transition.md"
    
  manual:
    command: "/idumb:complete-milestone"
    requires: "All phases verified"
```

## Content Aggregation

```yaml
aggregation:
  phases:
    from: ".planning/phases/{1..N}/"
    extract:
      - "CONTEXT.md → goals"
      - "PLAN.md → task counts"
      - "SUMMARY.md → completion stats"
      - "VERIFICATION.md → pass rates"
      
  metrics:
    calculate:
      - total_duration: "sum of phase durations"
      - pass_rate: "average of phase pass rates"
      - task_count: "sum of all tasks"
      
  learnings:
    from: "User feedback during phases"
    method: "Aggregate from session notes"
```

## Archive Behavior

```yaml
archive:
  on_complete:
    - "Copy all phase artifacts to archive"
    - "Create milestone summary"
    - "Clear execution directories"
    - "Update state to next milestone"
    
  archive_path: ".idumb/brain/archive/milestones/{milestone}/"
  
  retention:
    keep_indefinitely: true
    compress_after: "30 days"
```
